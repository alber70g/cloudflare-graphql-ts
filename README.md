### Usage

```bash
# Setup node_modules
npm i
# Run linter
npm run lint
# Run linter and fix where possible
npm run lint-fix
# Run tests
npm test
# Build development readable worker js file
npm run build-dev
# Build production minified worker js file
npm run build
```

The build will generate a `dist/index.js` which you can deploy to Cloudflare.
