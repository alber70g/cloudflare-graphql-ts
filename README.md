# GraphQL on the edge using Cloudflare

GraphQL on the edge, close to the customer, far from the servers. Just for
client/frontend developers who don't want to create waterfalls when querying
REST APIs. This is for those who want to build flexible and performant apps
queries.

### Usage

```bash
# Setup node_modules
npm i
# Run linter
npm run lint
# Run linter and fix where possible
npm run lint-fix
# Run tests
npm test
# Build development readable worker js file
npm run build-dev
# Build production minified worker js file
npm run build
# Setup wrangler and config
npm i @cloudflare/wrangler -g
wrangler config <email> <api_key>
# !!!! Change in wrangler.toml the account_id (you can find it
# !!!! when you login at dash.cloudflare.com/<account_id>)
# Build and publish (change this build:publish command when you
# want to publish prod)
npm run build:publish
```

The build will generate a `dist/index.js` which you can deploy to Cloudflare.

### Files and Directories
